Sammy’s Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes, beach chairs, and umbrellas to tourists.  Write a program that prompts the user for the number of minutes they rented the piece of sports equipment.  Compute the rental cost as $40 per hour plus $1 for each additional minute.  (You might have surmised already this rate has a logical flaw, but for now, calculate rates as described here.  You can fix the problem after we learn decision-making.)
