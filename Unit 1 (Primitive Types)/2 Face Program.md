Write a program that prints a face, using text characters, hopefully better looking than this one:

 

      ///////

      | o o |

     (|   ^ |)

      | \_/ |

      ------

Use comments to indicate when you print the hair, ears, mouth, and so on.

Name your class Face.java  (you do not need to add .java when creating the class)

 

Bring your program to the front to get graded.
