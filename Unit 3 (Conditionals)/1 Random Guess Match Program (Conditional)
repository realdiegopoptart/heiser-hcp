You have learned how to obtain a random number in a previous activity.
For example, the following statement generates a random number between the constants MIN and MAX inclusive and assigns it to a variable named random:
 
```java
 int random = 1 + (int)(Math.random()*MAX);
```

Write a program that selects a random number between 1 and 5 and asks the user to guess the number.  Display a message that indicates the difference between the random number and the user’s guess.  Display another message that displays the random number and the Boolean value true or false depending on whether the user’s guess equals the random number.  Save the file as RandomGuessMatch.java
