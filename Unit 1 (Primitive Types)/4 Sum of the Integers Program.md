Write a program that computes the sum of the first ten positive integers, 1 + 2 + ∙ ∙ ∙ + 10
hint: Write the program in the form:

```java
public class Classname

{

   public static void main(String[ ] args)

   {

     System.out.println( ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ );

   }

}
```

Name your class SumIntegers.java  (you do not need to add .java when creating the class)

 

Bring your program to the front to get graded.
