Mad Libs is a childrenâ€™s game in which the players provide a few words that are then incorporated into a silly story.  The game helps children understand different parts of speech because they are asked to provide specific types of words.  For example, you might ask a child for a noun, another noun, an adjective, and a past-tense verb.  The child might reply with such answers as table, book, silly, and studied.  The newly created Mad Lib might be:

 

Mary had a little table

Its book was silly as snow

And everywhere that Mary studied

The table was sure to go.
