Write a program that prints a Christmas tree:

 

                 /\

                /  \

               /    \

              /      \

              --------

                " "

                " "

                " "

Remember to use escape sequences to print the \ and " characters.

 

Name your class ChristmasTree.java  (you do not need to add .java when creating the class)

 

Bring your program to the front to get graded.
