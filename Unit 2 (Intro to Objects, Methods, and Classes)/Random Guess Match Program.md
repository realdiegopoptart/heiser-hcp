Create an application that will generate a random integer.  Ask the user to input their guess for the random integer between low and high (you determine the range) and display true or false if he values are the same.  Make sure to show the computer's random number which was generated, the user's guess, and whether they matched for final output.

Math.random() creates a decimal number between 0 and 1

If num1 and num2 are integers, then the expression num1 == num2 will give a true or false boolean status.

Name the program RandomGuessMatch.java
