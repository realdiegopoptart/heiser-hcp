Write a program that computes the sum of the reciprocals 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + … + 1/ 10.  This is harder than it sounds.  Try writing the program, and check the result.  The program’s result isn’t likely to be correct.  Then write the numbers as floating-point numbers, 1.0, 2.0, … 10.0, and run the program again.  Can you explain the difference in the results?

Name your class SumRecoprocals.java  (you do not need to add .java when creating the class)

 

Bring your program to the front to get graded.
