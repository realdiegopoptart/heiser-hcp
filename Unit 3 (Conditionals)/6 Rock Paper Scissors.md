In the game Rock Paper Scissors, two players simultaneously choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. If both players choose the same option, then the result is a tie. However, if they choose differently, the winner is determined as follows:

·     Rock beats scissors, because rock can break a pair of scissors

__   ·     Scissors beats paper, because scissors can cut paper

__·     Paper beats rock, because a piece of paper can cover a rock

Create a game in which the computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors. Let the user enter a number 1, 2, or 3, each representing one of the three choices. Then, determine the winner. Save the application as RockPaperScissors.java
