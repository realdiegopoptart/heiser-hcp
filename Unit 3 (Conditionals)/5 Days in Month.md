Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (1 = January, 2 = February, and so on) and then prints the number of days of the month. For February, print "28 days".  You will use a switch statement to accomplish this task.  If they enter an invalid month, it needs to let them know.  (hint:  default part of switch)

Sample Program Runs:
					

```
Enter the month number: 8

There are 31 days
```
  		

```
Enter the month number: 0

ERROR: Bad Input
```

```
Enter the month number: 15

ERROR: Bad Input
```
