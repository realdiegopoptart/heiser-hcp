·        The difference

·        The product

·        The average

·        The distance (absolute value of the difference)

·        The maximum ( the larger of the two numbers)

·        The minimum ( the smaller of the two numbers)

                        The square root
                        The frst number raised to the second number (Hint: use pow)

Save your program to a file named Pair.java
